abstract: "Someone who learns to walk shortest paths in New York can, upon receiving a map of Paris, immediately apply the same rule to navigate, despite never having practiced in Paris. This ability to apply known rules to novel input combinations exemplifies compositional generalization (CG), a hallmark of human cognition. While transformer models have shown both successes and failures on CG tests, our understanding of **when can('t) CG occur, particularly from the perspective of the training data distribution**, remains limited. In this work, we investigate how train-data distributional properties (e.g., coverage, diversity, and sampling biases) jointly shape CG via quantitative analysis on controlled map navigation tasks."
